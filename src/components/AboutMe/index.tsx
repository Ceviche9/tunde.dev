        As a software developer from Cear√°, I'm passionate about technology,
        music, and history. My focus lies in backend development using
        TypeScript, and I prioritize creating scalable and high-quality code,
        following SOLID and Clean Code principles. My experience spans across a
        variety of technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, Express, MongoDB,
        Jest, Prisma, and Docker.

        I am deeply committed to code quality, ensuring it's clean, readable,
        and well-documented. I believe well-structured code not only facilitates
        collaboration among teams but also reduces long-term maintenance costs.
        I am constantly seeking new challenges and exciting projects where I can
        apply my knowledge and experience to create innovative solutions.
